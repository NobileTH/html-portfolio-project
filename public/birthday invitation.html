    <p>Hello, I have an important message to tell you. On my birthday, May 3rd, you need to prepare something nice.
        Because I have a lot of exciting plans for us to do together.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Here's my advice.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>My favorite games such as Mario Kart, Among Us, Minecraft or anything we can have fun playing.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Movies I want to watch like Avengers, Star Wars, Harry Potter or anything with adventure and fantasy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Delicious food that I'm hungry for, such as pizza, ice cream, brownies, or anything sweet and delicious.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you prepare these things for me I will be very happy.
        Thank you in advance and looking forward to my birthday.</p>
    <br>
